## About Me ##
I am a senior at the University of Florida studying political science and advertising. I am hoping to start my masters in the summer of 2023 in communications with a focus in web design. 

## Past Coding Experience ##
I do not have much coding experience besides R. I used this program for my thesis for one of my political science classes.

## Career Goals ##
* I want to graduate with my masters focusing in web design.
* I am aiming to get a job following graduation where I get to practice my skills I learned in my masters program while also earning enough money to support myself.
* I hope to either work remote or have enough vacation where I can travel and explore more of the world.
